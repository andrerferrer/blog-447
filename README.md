# Extra notes:
## To create a new rails app from zero

- rails new
- cd into the folder
- git add commit and push (to push we need to `hub create` first)

after having the set up ready, we need to:

1. Create the Model

- generate the Model
- generate associations and validations (Tomorrow!)
- seed! (create some examples in the database)

2. Create the Mantras ðŸ•‰

- Routes
- Controller
- View
